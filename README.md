# Question 1 - Greatest Product
##### By Luca Santarelli

## The solution
There are two files in this question directory, `largest_product.py` and `grids_to_test.py`. The first one is the entry point script that will be run to execute the solution to this problem. The second script is where example grids, to test the solution, are defined. These are imported in the entry point script, for the solution to be tested.

To run the solution, simply run, in the `ao_question_1` directory `python3 largest_product.py`.
